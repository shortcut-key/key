A keyboard shortcut is one or more keys used to perform a menu function or other common functions in a program or operating system. Keyboard shortcuts usually are not as intuitive as point-and-click mouse actions. However, they can be used by novice users in frequently used programs to get to locations much faster than using the mouse.
